# redditscraping
I made this script to help people fetch comments from a particular link on reddit


steps:
1- download code
2- pip install all imported libraries in the main.py
3- go to reddit.com and sign in
4- go to reddit.com/prefs/apps
5- create a new reddit application (script) not web nor the other one
6- copy your own client_id, client_secret, usename, and password
7- go to main.py file and paste them in thier places

now you got your own code that will help you fetch all comments from a specific reddit post
I use the PRAW Lib, so you can check its documentation for further information
